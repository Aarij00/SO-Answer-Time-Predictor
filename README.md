# Stack Overflow Answer Time Predictor

## Description
This project is a Python program that uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the time between a Stack Overflow question being posted and it being answered by a user. The project leverages big data processing tools and machine learning techniques to analyze and model the data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PySpark
- NumPy
## Main Libraries
- pandas
- pyspark
- numpy
- sklearn

## Project Structure
- `code.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete project code, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Contains `csv` data. (Note: data was downloaded using `wget` in project code)
- `requirements.txt`: Must be installed for execution.

## Getting Started
